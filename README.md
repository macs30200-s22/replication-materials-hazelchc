# How does an increase in status affect the evaluation of quality?

### Initial finding:
- An increase in status causes a decrease in the movie's average rating following the announcement of the award
  - As shown in the table, the ratings of award-winning movies after the winner is announced are on average 0.728 points (out of 10) lower than their nominated pairs
  - The results are marginally significant (i.e. p-value = 0.050)

### Relevance to the RQ:
- The initial finding answers the first research question: getting an Oscars award leads to a decrease in the winning movie's average rating after the award announcement. This finding is in line with the existing studies on the dark side of attaining high organizational status. This raises the question of why, and I would further explore it.
